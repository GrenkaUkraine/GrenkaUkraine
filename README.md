## Hobbies and Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me learning to play the guitar, designing websites, creating 3D models, or making music. You can view my 3D models on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/grenkaukraine) and listen to my music (mostly phonks) on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5BJ7VjFiHPOBu02GcePuFu). I believe that creativity in art fuels creativity in programming, and I strive to blend both passions in my projects.
